Phytoplankton, tiny ocean plants, absorb light, and measuring this in coastal areas is tricky. This study tested a method called the Quasi-Analytical-Algorithm to measure how much light phytoplankton absorb at a specific light wavelength (443 nm) in different sea areas using both on-site data and satellite images. The results were best in the East China Sea, okay in Ise-Mikawa Bay, and not good in the Ariake Sea, showing different patterns in each location.

The study found that accurately estimating the total light absorption in the water was crucial for getting good results. They also looked at how much materials other than water, like dissolved substances and other particles, absorb light. Mistakes in measuring these materials led to errors in the total absorption calculation.

They tried using actual measured values instead of estimated ones to see if it improved accuracy. Changing these values affected the results' accuracy, suggesting that errors might relate to how light bounces off particles in the water.

The study suggests future research should try methods that don't assume specific patterns for how light is scattered by particles and should consider using a different approach that focuses on red and near-infrared light. These might help improve accuracy in measuring how much light phytoplankton absorb.
