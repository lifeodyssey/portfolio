- Happy to see you here. I'm currently working as a backend engineer @[/thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us).

- I pursuited my Master's Degree in Earth and Environmental Sciences at [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/), supported by Prof. [Joji Ishizaka](https://marine.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/labhp/member/ishizaka/index-j.htm) in the field of Japan **coastal ocean color remote sensing** and **ocean optics**. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Marine Resource and Environment at [Ocean University of China](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/]) in the [finshery oceanography lab](https://scxy.ouc.edu.cn/fol/) under the instruction from Prof. [Yang Liu](https://scxy.ouc.edu.cn/fol/2020/1118/c18408a307082/page.htm) in the field of **Fishery Production Prediction based on machine learning** .

- During my master course, I focused on how to improve the accuracy of phytoplankton optical properties algorithms via a new understanding of backscattering properties and utilized machie learning technique in a data limited secnario. During that time I wrote a lot of script to process data and received plenty of connections and appreicate of my colledges in the field of ocean color remote sensing. These warming words finally led me to a software engineer to helping others via my skills.
